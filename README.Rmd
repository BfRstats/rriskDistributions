# rriskDistributions

[![CRAN_Status_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/rriskDistributions)](http://cran.r-project.org/package=rriskDistributions)
[![travis_build_badge_for_dev_branch](https://travis-ci.org/BfRstats/rriskDistributions.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/BfRstats/rriskDistributions)

`rriskDistributions` is a collection of functions for fitting distributions to given data or 
known quantiles.

The two main functions `fit.perc()` and `fit.cont()` provide users a GUI that 
allows to choose a most appropriate distribution without any knowledge of the 
R syntax. Note that this package is part of the [rrisk](http://www.bfr.bund.de/en/rrisk__risk_modelling_and_auto_reporting_in_r-52162.html) project.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.path = "README-"
)
```

E.g., we can fit random data generated from a gamma distribution with `fit.cont()`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
res <- fit.cont(data2fit = rgamma(n = 37, shape = 4, rate = 0.08))
```

This will open a new window where the user can inspect diagnostic plots for a variety of possible distributions and then choose the distribution she wants to continue working with (the chosen distribution will be stored in the `res` variable):
